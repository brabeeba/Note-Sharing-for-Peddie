# Note Sharing for Peddie
## Overview
This is the rails app I did for Peddie School under classmate's request. You are able to sign up as a user, follow other users, classes and leave your note and comments to your fellow classmates.
## Framework
<b>Back end</b>: Ruby on Rails <br>
<b>Test</b>: Rspec, Guard, Spork, Capybara
## Usage
Update the gem by
```
bundle intall
bundle update
```
You might need to migrate the database by running
```
bin/rake db:migrate
```
And then start your server by
```
rails s
```
Your website will be at
```
localhost:3000
```
